	// =============================================
	/**
	* HOW TO SET UP GAME LOGGER:
	* Once the players are established, you can select which players/phases you want to track.
	* For tracking players:
	*		Create a playerlogger decorator and pass the player's name, as a string. This is why the playerlist must be
	*		esblished before you can choose which players to track. The names must be passed exactly as they are:
	*		there is no case-correction applied.
	* For tracking phases:
	*		Create a phaselogger decorator and pass one of three phases, as strings: "reinforcement", "attack" or "fortification",
	*		exactly as they are written, without quotes. The phases each call notify() with these exact arguments, and so the decorator
	*		must match them to the letter in order for them to be recorded.
	* Chaining decorators:
	*		Decorators can be chained. For example, you can track player1 and also track their reinforcement + attack phases. Simply add
	*		a playerlogger for "player1", a phaselogger for "reinforcement" and a phaselogger for "attack".
	* On modifying the basic logger:
	*		The basic logger simply logs everything. However, as soon as you add one decorator, it nullifies the entire logger, meaning
	*		it will be set to track NO phase and NO player until you explicitly add them yourself. In other words, you will have either no
	*		decorators, or *at least* two: one for the player, and one for the phase. Example: adding only a playerlogger for player1 and nothing
	*		else will result in nothing being logged: you must also provide at least one phase to be logged, as well.
	* Happy logging!!!
