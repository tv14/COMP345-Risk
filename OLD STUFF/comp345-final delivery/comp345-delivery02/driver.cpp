	/**
	 * HOW TO SET UP GAME LOGGER:
	 * Once the players are established, you can select which players/phases you want to track.
	 * For tracking players:
	 *		Create a playerlogger decorator and pass the player's name, as a string. This is why the playerlist must be
	 *		esblished before you can choose which players to track. The names must be passed exactly as they are:
	 *		there is no case-correction applied.
	 * For tracking phases:
	 *		Create a phaselogger decorator and pass one of three phases, as strings: "reinforcement", "attack" or "fortification",
	 *		exactly as they are written, without quotes. The phases each call notify() with these exact arguments, and so the decorator
	 *		must match them to the letter in order for them to be recorded.
	 * Chaining decorators:
	 *		Decorators can be chained. For example, you can track player1 and also track their reinforcement + attack phases. Simply add
	 *		a playerlogger for "player1", a phaselogger for "reinforcement" and a phaselogger for "attack".
	 * On modifying the basic logger:
	 *		The basic logger simply logs everything. However, as soon as you add one decorator, it nullifies the entire logger, meaning
	 *		it will be set to track no phase and no player until you explicitly add them yourself. In other words, you will have either no
	 *		decorators, or *at least* two: one for the player, and one for the phase. Example: adding only a playerlogger for player1 and nothing
	 *		else will result in nothing being logged: you must also provide at least one phase to be logged, as well.
	 * Have fun logging!!!
